# SimpleChefGame
Explore my knowledge in python programming using Graphic library.
<br>

## Instructions
Save all the files in the same folder and/or adjust the directory when they are called in the main program.
<br>

## Idea
After learning about Graphic Class I decided to build a basic game about the famus carachter Kirbi collecting ingredints for his own restaurant.
<br>

## Structure
The game start with a little video that introduce the story line. Then the menu of the game opens and you are ready to chose between diffrent lvels. A timer starts and you have to collect 'ingredient' and put them in the hoven before the timer runs out.
In each level the difficulty increase, the map change, the ingreadient are more distance and the timer addjust... you have to be fast!
<br>

## Evaluation
Really basic implementation, many feature can be improved such as the movment, the graphical interface and so on. But to sum up it is a perfect way to start lerning about game implementation without 'pygame' library.
